### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhavirdy/clear-scan.git
   cd clear-scan
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5050
   ```

### Alternative Installation Methods

#### Using Development Mode
For developers who want to make changes to the codebase:
```bash
pip install -e .
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python3 run.py
```

#### Using Production Setup
For production deployment (not recommended for development):
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5050 --workers 4 app:app
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use:**
If port 5050 is already in use, you can change it in `run.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)  # Change port number
```

**Module Not Found Errors:**
Ensure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment is activated:
```bash
cd clear-scan
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Permission Denied:**
On macOS/Linux, you might need to use `sudo` for system-wide installation:
```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Browser Not Loading:**
- Check if the application started successfully (look for "Running on http://..." message)
- Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5050` instead
- Disable any ad blockers or browser extensions
- Clear browser cache and cookies
